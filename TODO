BUSINESS LOGIC
	The old site can be simplified to the following organization scheme.
	- Contains links to pages with the page contents (as modelled above)
	- Contains link to news page with contents (as modelled above)
	- All pages contains random student profile on side with information
	  as modelled above.
	With that simple scheme, the entire web contents can be database generated
	making it possible for Admin to change/update almost every content of 
	the site without having to re-write codes of the website.(all from admin)
	
Advantages of the above business logic.
	- Admin and add/remove pages from admin interface.
	- Successful utilization of M-V-C (Model-Views-Controller) architecture.
	- Quick change of any part of the system from admin.
