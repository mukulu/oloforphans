Remaining TODOs.
1. Creation of fancy templates with place holders for displaying the flat pages created by moderator
   we have the sample already. it's just transformation.
2. Add news plugin app, that follows django-cms standards to show up in navigation menu.
3. Add students plugin app, for displaying separate navigation menu of students in django-cms and for ajax
   random display on any place holder of the template.(like in old site)
IF WE'RE DONE WITH THIS WE'RE DONE WITH THE PROJECT

IF HE'S WILLING TO POUR IN MORE CASH, (We'll put the following)
1. To locate the school, incase volunteers want to know where it is, how many miles from where they are
   this should take long, since plugins are there.
2. Google search form, for quick access to google search. and results get displayed within same website.
   like what mint or ubuntu does in their websites.
3. Image & Gallery management, so they get to keep & edit photos of events online, and pull them anytime
   they want to incorporate it in their pages.


FUNCTIONALITIES
1. Admin interface ( Updating page contents and enduser profiles by authorized personnel)
2. Database generated pdf profiles of students (hard-coded in old system)
3. Up-to-date information on student profiles (database driven)
4. Student and staffs login accounts, (Students can update their profile
   profile information at their convenient time.)
5. Comments on posted news, (like it/hate it). using django.contrib.comments.moderation

BUSINESS LOGIC
	The old site can be simplified to the following organization scheme.
	- Contains links to pages with the page contents (as modelled above)
	- Contains link to news page with contents (as modelled above)
	- All pages contains random student profile on side with information
	  as modelled above.
	With that simple scheme, the entire web contents can be database generated
	making it possible for Admin to change/update almost every content of 
	the site without having to re-write codes of the website.(all from admin)
	
Advantages of the above business logic.
	- Admin and add/remove pages from admin interface.
	- Successful utilization of M-V-C (Model-Views-Controller) architecture.
	- Quick change of any part of the system from admin.
